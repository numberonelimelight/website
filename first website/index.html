      <h3>This website is about my life!</h3>
      <h3>It provides basic information about me and my life!</h3>
      <h3>It starts from the background of my name, to what I like, and what my hobbies are.</h3>
<h1>My Background</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Gizelle Shoshani and I am 12 years old. My family is originated from Iraq. I am fluent in English but I also speak Arabic, Aramaic, and I am currently learning Spanish. I understand more than I speak. My grandparents are immagrants from Iraq to America and now currently live in America with my family and I. 
    </p>
<h1>My Favortie Things</h1>
<p>
  Out of everything in this world, I love to play sports! I also like to talk to my friends either in person, over text, or over facetime. My favorite book that I have read is called <i>Five Feet Apart</i>. If I am not playing sports or hanging out with my friends, I like to hang out with my family. I also love making people laugh and smile, even though I do not smile much myself because it hurts my face. I also like playing video games. If I am bored and have absolutely nothing to do, I will read. Some things that I am interested in is space. When I was little, my sister and I wanted to be astronauts. Of course, that was before we knew about the dangers of outer space and the process of even getting there.       </p>

    		<h1> A little more about me</h1>
    		<p> I was born on March 19th 2007. I am in seventh grade and I am also a fan of the Vegas Golden Knights. I have two siblings, a younger brother, and an older sister. So, I am the middle child of the family. My sister is my twin, she is only older by a minute and forty seconds. My sister's name is Gianna and my brothers name is Jaden. I like to draw on my free time or talk to my friends. My favorite food is pizza and my favorite soda is either orange soda or sprite. My favorite band is Why Don't We and my favorite member from the band is Corbyn Besson (judge me all you want I don't care). My favorite colors are black, grey, white, and purple and I love shoes. My favorite thing to wear is my tie dye blue and purple hoodie or my Supreme over sized shirt and some shorts or leggings. I am also told that I am very funny and my family tells me I am the house comedian. When I have some free time I like to go on my laptop and watch youtube or go on this website called Wattpad and write fan fictions for other people to read! I enjoy space and learning about the universe even though I do <b>not</b> like science.</p>
