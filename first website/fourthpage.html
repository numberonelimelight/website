<h1>My Personality</h1>
<p>I am weird. I am a very weird person. I am not normal. I do not do normal things. I am different from everyone else around me. I am not interested in everything that a lot of people are interested in. In a lot of things people do, I do differently. Such as when I do a math problem, i figure out the problem differently. I do not really know if anybody cares about that but, whatever. I am not a very girly person, I am more into playing games and going online. I sometimes creep people out with my fingers because I am double jointed in my fingers on my left hand and I can do weird things with my tongue and I can also make my eye twitch which I guess is very weird. 
	<h1>The End!!</h1>
	<p>Well, there is my life, I hoped you learned a lot. (If you did not and thought my life was boring and thought this webstie was completely useless than thats ok I guess whatever I don't really care.) Thank you for clicking on this website. 
		Goodbye.
