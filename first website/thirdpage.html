<h1> My favorite singers</h1>
<p> My favortie singers right now are Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. If I had to choose a band that I loved, it would be Why Don't We. For everyone who knows me and hates this band, don't you dare judge me because there are also things you like that I don't like. So, if you judge me, I will never be your friend again. (Just kidding).</p>
